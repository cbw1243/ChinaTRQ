Step 1. Click on the green button "Clone or download", and then select "Download ZIP";

Step 2. Unzip the downloaded zipped file;

Step 3. Go to the “Codes” folder and then open the “do.r” file using the R software. If you do not have one, you need to install R (with R studio for better experience) into your computer.
