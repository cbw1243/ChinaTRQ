# General information

This folder contains R codes for replicating the key results in the paper **“Tariff Quota Administration in China's Grain Markets: An Empirical Assessment”** by B. Chen, N. Villoria, and X. Tian published at **Agricultural Economics**. 

# Instructions 
For replicating the paper, go to the “Codes” folder and then simply run the R codes in the “do.r” file. Some figures will be automatically generated under the “Codes.r” folder. The regression results will also appear in R, though they are not saved as unique files. 

Please be noted that you shall ensure that the working directory of R is the place where you save the R codes.
